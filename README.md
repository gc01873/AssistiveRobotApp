# AssistiveRobotApp
The cumulative work of three programmers as a final project.
This is meant to be an open-source project that can be used to help differently abled and elderly individuals. 

The files to be ran on a raspberry pi connected with an arduino are in the Tag-Along folder. They are Robot-prototype.py,arduino_m.py,GPSService2.py. Basically all files ending with the python extension.
All other files can be ran in Android Studio.
